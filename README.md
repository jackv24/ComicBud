# ComicWrap

NOTE: Currently in development!

ComicWrap is an open source webcomic reader and tracker for Android and iOS. It is intended for reading webcomics that are published on their own websites.

### Main Idea: No Piracy

This app is not intended to scrape comic websites. Instead, comics are read directly on the website like a normal web browser. This ensures that the app does not have a negative effect on things such as ad revenue for the webcomic creator.

Why not just use a web browser?

This app provides some extra features:
  - Collecting your library in one place
  - Tracking what pages you've read
  - Notifying when a new page has been released
